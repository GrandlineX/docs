## Why GrandLineX was started ?

**A**: This project was started because I wanted to build a modular framework that is easy to use and uses as little as possible other dependency's.
Because of this, the core package only depending on one JS/TS language-feature package. 

## What means modular framework ?

**A**: A modular framework is one that scopes project-functionality into several divided bundles with seperated resources like a Database Connections or a Web-Server. 
       These bundles are called Modules. 
       They are working standalone and can be used in other projects. The only requirement is that they are registered in a GLX-Runtime. 
       The Project serves tree types of Runtime's these are the three Kernel packages. 
       In the concept chapter you can find more information about the project environment.
